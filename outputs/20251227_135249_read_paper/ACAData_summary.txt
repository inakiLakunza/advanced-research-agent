Abstract:
We present ACAData, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, that consists of two subsets: ACAD-train, which contains approximately 1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs across 12 languages, and ACAD-bench, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12 directions. To validate its usefulness, we fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-train and benchmark them on ACAD-bench against specialized machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on ACAD-train leads to improvements in academic translation quality by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model surpasses the best proprietary and open-weight models in the academic translation domain. By releasing ACAD-train, ACAD-bench, and the fine-tuned models, we provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in the academic domain and long-context translation.

Key Points:
1. Introduction of ACAData, a parallel dataset for academic translation.
2. Two subsets: ACAD-train (1.5 million paragraph pairs) and ACAD-bench (6,000 translations).
3. Fine-tuning of LLMs shows significant improvements in translation quality.
4. Release of dataset and models aims to support research in academic translation.
