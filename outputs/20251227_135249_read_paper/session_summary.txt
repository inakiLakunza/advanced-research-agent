Agent Response:
I extracted the content from the PDF titled "ACAData: Parallel Dataset of Academic Data for Machine Translation." Here’s a summary of the key information:

- **Authors**: Iñaki Lacunza, Javier Garcia Gilabert, Francesca De Luca Fornaciari, Javier Aula-Blasco, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Maite Melero, Marta Villegas
- **Affiliation**: Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)
- **Contact Emails**: 
  - inaki.lacunza@bsc.es
  - javier.garcia1@bsc.es
  - fdelucaf@bsc.es

- **Abstract**: The paper presents ACAData, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, consisting of two subsets: ACAD-train (1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs across 12 languages) and ACAD-bench (nearly 6,000 translations). The authors fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-train, showing significant improvements in academic translation quality. The dataset and models are released to support research in the academic domain and long-context translation.

- **Keywords**: Academic Translation, Multilingual Dataset, Machine Translation, Parallel Corpus

- **Key Points**:
  1. Introduction of ACAData for academic translation.
  2. Two subsets: ACAD-train and ACAD-bench.
  3. Fine-tuning of LLMs results in significant translation quality improvements.
  4. The release of the dataset and models aims to advance research.

I saved all this information into a text file named **ACAData_summary.txt** in the designated output folder.
