User Query:
Write code to generate Fibonacci numbers up to 1000, create both a line plot and histogram of the values, analyze the distribution, and save everything to fib_analysis.txt

==================================================

Agent Response:
I completed the following tasks:

1. **Generated Fibonacci Numbers**: I wrote code to generate Fibonacci numbers up to 1000, resulting in the sequence: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987]`.

2. **Created Visualizations**:
   - A **line plot** of the Fibonacci numbers was generated and saved as `fibonacci_line_plot.png`.
   - A **histogram** of the Fibonacci numbers was created and saved as `fibonacci_histogram.png`.

3. **Analyzed Distribution**: I performed a distribution analysis on the Fibonacci numbers, providing:
   - Q1 (25th percentile): 3.00
   - Median (Q2): 21.00
   - Q3 (75th percentile): 144.00
   - Interquartile Range (IQR): 141.00

4. **Saved Results**: All results, including the Fibonacci sequence and the distribution analysis, were saved to a text file named `fib_analysis.txt`.

Everything is stored in the output directory for your reference.
