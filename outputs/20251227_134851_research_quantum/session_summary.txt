User Query:
Research quantum computing on Wikipedia and save a summary

==================================================

Agent Response:
I researched quantum computing on Wikipedia and extracted a concise summary. The summary highlights that a quantum computer is a device that utilizes superposed and entangled states, allowing it to sample from quantum systems and operate on numerous possibilities simultaneously, unlike classical computers which follow deterministic rules. 

I saved this summary to a text file named "quantum_computing_summary.txt" in the designated output folder.
