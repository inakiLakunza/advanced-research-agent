User Query:
Research machine learning on Wikipedia, calculate how many neurons would be in a 4-layer neural network with sizes [784, 256, 128, 10], create a bar chart of layer sizes, and save everything to a report

==================================================

Agent Response:
I completed the following tasks for your request:

1. **Research on Machine Learning**: I retrieved information from Wikipedia, summarizing that machine learning (ML) is a field in artificial intelligence focused on statistical algorithms that learn from data and generalize to new data.

2. **Neurons Calculation**: I calculated the total number of neurons in a 4-layer neural network with sizes [784, 256, 128, 10], resulting in a total of 1178 neurons.

3. **Data Visualization**: I created a bar chart visualizing the layer sizes of the neural network, which has been saved as "neural_network_layer_sizes.png".

4. **Report Generation**: I compiled the research, calculation, and visualization into a report, which has been saved as "machine_learning_report.txt".

You can find both the report and the plot in the designated output folder.
